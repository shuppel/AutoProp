# AutoProp
## Automated RFP Template Generator & Proposal Provider

**AutoProp** is a python-based pdf spider and automated template tool that uses federal proposal-based best practices to generate helpful proposal documents for its users. Federal Business Development teams would be able to utilize this tool to quickly iterate through proposals without having to read through repetative documents and pull all necessary requirements into an external document that can then be distributed across business units. 

**Operating System & Framework**
OS: Linux-based (Ubuntu) 
Infrastructure: Python3 and PostgreSQL are being used in MVP one, potentially branching to JS5 to create a browser-based extension plug in for users to drop and drag pdfs.
